		<h1>Turtling</h1> <!-- Content -->
		<p> Turtling is basically where someone boxes themselves with 4 walls around them and a floor+pyramid above their heads. Previously I mentioned that most of the time you should contest for highground
		but sometimes staying on low ground might be a better scenario for certain situations as I will give certain scenarios further throughout this page.</p>

		<h2> Why Turtle? </h2> <!-- Content -->
		<p> There are many situations where turtling would be the most optimal play and in most situations you would turtle when:</p>
		<ul> <!-- Set up a list -->
			<li> You have to heal up</li>
			<li> You are low on materials </li>
			<li> You have to disengage from a fight because you are too high up </li>
			<li> You want to simply outskill your opponent </li>
		</ul>
	
		<h2> What does turtling do? </h2> <!-- Content -->
		<p> If you are turtled properly that means there is very little chance of you getting harmed by other players unless a certain piece falls off, this means you are protected for the time being in the box. 
		If there is someone trying to get into your box, then turtling can stall a lot of time for eiether your teammate (if you are playing duos/squads) or another opponent to eliminate the one contesting you.
		Basically, turtling offers you a lot of protection in the game. I also mentioned that you can turtle to outskill your opponent and this can be used by <a href="editing.html">editing</a>, here's an

		<h2> How can you counter the turtle strategy </h2> <!-- Content -->
		<p> If you can turtle, so can your opponents and it can be pretty annoying since it&apos;s<!-- Special characters -->almost impossible regaining control of an opponent&apos;s<!-- Special characters -->build if they are holding down left button on the piece. 
		There are many ways that have a really good chance of countering a turtler but the most consistent method would be <a href="editing.html">phasing</a>. This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFESCu8Z_3k&t=82s"> <!-- Linking -->
