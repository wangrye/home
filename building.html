		<h1>Building</h1> <!-- Content -->
		<p> Building is a very important skill if not, the most important skill in fortnite and will be the key to outplaying your opponents. In fortnite there are materials: wood,brick,metal. Every building piece
		takes 10 materials from which every type of material you select. Also there are only 4 different type of &quot;builds&quot;,this includes walls, floors, stairs, and pyramids/cones. 
		Every individual piece serves its own purpose however, and I bet you already know the basics, so I&apos;sm going to explain the more advanced techniques into becoming a pro.</p>

		<h2> 90s </h2><!-- Content -->
		<p> In fortnite a huge building strategy is to take highground, this is basically where you try your best to build above your opposing enemy/enemies, doing so
		there is a very fast and advanced techinque to overtake highground very easily, and this method is called<!-- Special characters -->&quot;90ing&quot;. The term &quot;90&quot;<!-- Special characters -->is basically stacking up really
		fast by rotating 90 degrees each time. Learning this technique might take a while but it is definitely worth the time spending. There are many different ways pros like to 
		90, but I will only explain the Classic 90. The Classic 90 is basically where you put one stair, then a wall directly infront and above the stair, then rotating a 90 degrees (clock or counter )
		to place another wall, then another wall below the previous one, a floor and jump, and then finally another stair 90 degrees (counter or clock) from the previous stair. You can repeat the process as
		many times as you want. Here's a clip to make it easier:</p>

		<h2>Coning</h2><!-- Content -->
		<p> This method is mostly used when you are on the low-ground and your opponent has high-ground. The term &quot;Coning&quot;<!-- Special characters -->is basically when you place a pyramid or sometimes even a floor on the opponent who has the highground.
		Once you cone off the opponent most of the time you will do a <a href=#jumpout>jumpout</a> or if you have traps, you may trap your opponent. Traps are basically items that can be found throughout the game
		within the ground, chests, player loot, etc, and does 150 damage if the opponent is within range and can only be placed on floors and walls. When you cone your opponent, to trap them, you will need to place
		a wall surrounding them and then placing the trap. There are ways to prevent this from happening for example: placing a wall and floor so it's not possible to cone, or preplacing the pyramid/floor yourself
		and <a href="editing.html">editing</a>.</p>
		<p> Here's a short clip of coning and jumpout:</p>

		<h2 id="jumpout">Jump Outs</h2><!-- Content -->
		<p> If you looked previously in the short little clip, after he placed the cone he went off the to the side and &quot;jumped out&quot;<!-- Special characters -->by placing a stair and floor and <a href="editing.html">editing</a><!-- Referencing link -->through
		the floor, this is one way to retake your high-ground because the opponent will have to eiether do a jumpout himself or has to stair backwards eiether way, you will get high-ground before your opponent.
		This is just one way of jumping out, however there are multiple ways of jumping out for example, jumping out from the right or left and catching yourself with a floor only. There are other more flashy techniques
		that will take a lot of time to learn however their reward isn&apos;t<!-- Special characters -->that high. So here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfFqUzB-GCY">example</a> <!-- Linking -->of just jumping out and catching yourself with a floor.</p>
