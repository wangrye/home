		<h1> What is Fortnite?</h1> <!-- Content -->
		<p> Fortnite is third person shooter game created by Epic Games and originally released during 2017, consisting of 100 players where you can play alone, with a partner or with a squad (3 other players) to fight other players. 
		There are various types of items such as grenades, rocket launchers, shotguns etc, and you can find &quot;meds&quot;<!-- Special characters -->to heal yourself up incase of emergencies. You start off with 100 health and if you are lucky enough, 
		you can find various items that give you<!-- Special characters -->&quot;shield&quot;. The maximum amount of shield you can have is 100, and your starting health is 100.</p>
		
		<h1> Objective </h1>
		<p> The game does consist of 100 players and your goal is to eliminate as many people as you can, 
		and try to be the last solo/duo/squad alive and you obtain a &quot; Victory royale &quot; (Winning).</p>
		<img src = "vicroy.jpg" alt="Picture of a victory royale" class="img" width= 20% height=20%> <!-- Add image and give it a class and measurements -->
		
		<h1> Deaths </h1> <!-- Content and give a list -->
		<p> If you are new to this game, there are many ways you can die, this includes:<p>
		<ul>
			<li> Fall Damage (Building too high and falling)</li>
			<li> Getting eliminated by other opponents</li>
			<li> Falling off the edge </li>
			<li> Dying to the storm </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1> Storm </h1> <!-- Content -->
		<p> I've previously mentioned that dying to the &quot;Storm&quot;<!-- Special characters -->is a way to die, 
		however if you are new to the game, the storm is an ingame mechanic where it forces out players out of a certain area and moving in 
		to the circle (it will be showcased on your radar if you look at the top right), and if not, you will take damage. 
		The circle will become smaller and smaller every certain amount of time, and every time the circle gets smaller, the storm will do more damage! </p>

		<h1> Becoming Pro </h1> <!-- Content -->
		<p> This game might seem basic as certain people only see it as &quot;<!-- Special characters -->You build, shoot&quot;<!-- Special characters -->however, there is a lot more skill and strategy involved to be the best
		and throughout this webpage, I will be talking about all the different techniques that can be used to outclass your opponents, making you closer to become the best of them 
		all! </p>
